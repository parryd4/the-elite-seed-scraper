This repository is a personal exercise in scraping data and writing into CSV files which will later be used to seed a database for the creation of an API.

My first attempt at scraping was a [simple version](https://github.com/parryd4/simple-scraper-the-elite). This will access and gather more data.

Data on The-elite.net is accessible without an account. The reason I started this scraping project was because I noticed the-elite was lacking an API, and I thought it would be a fun project to build one for them. I need data to mimic behavior and performance and so I shall scrape it.

None of the data scraped is intended for ANY use other than my own learning experience and interest.
